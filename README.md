# Bitcoin Factory Report History
This directory contains historical Bitcoin Factory Report files.

To keep the size of the main repository as small as possible, this directory is included to the main Superalgos repository as a submodule.

By purpose, this directory is not automatically pulled when running node setupPlugins but must be manually obtained via a git pull command.
